# 🚀 Auto-Blocking System - Quick Start

## What Was Added?

A **fully automated threat blocking system** that:
- 🛡️ Automatically blocks high-risk IPs (score ≥ 75)
- 🎯 Triggers when admin loads dashboard
- 🔄 Can be manually triggered with "Scan & Block Now" button
- 📊 Shows real-time blocking status in dashboard
- 🔐 Prevents duplicate blocks
- 📝 Logs all actions for audit trail

---

## Where to Find It?

### In the Code
**Backend**: `backend/app.py` (line 1625)
- New endpoint: `POST /api/admin/auto-block-threats`
- Scans cached threats, validates IPs, creates blocks

**Frontend**: `frontend/src/components/AdminDashboard.js`
- Auto-block function: `autoBlockThreats()` (line 302)
- Display section: "🛡️ Auto-Blocked High-Risk Threats" (line 682)
- Manual button: "🔄 Scan & Block Now"

### In the Dashboard
When you login as admin and visit `/admin`:
1. Dashboard loads automatically
2. After 1 second, auto-blocking starts
3. You see alert: "🛡️ Auto-Blocked X high-risk threats!"
4. Scroll down to see "🛡️ Auto-Blocked High-Risk Threats" section
5. Table shows all auto-blocked IPs with details

---

## How to Test

### Test 1: Auto-Block on Dashboard Load
```
1. Login using the administrator credentials configured through environment variables.
2. Go to Admin Dashboard (/admin)
3. You should see an alert after 1-2 seconds
4. Alert shows number of IPs auto-blocked
5. Scroll down to "Auto-Blocked High-Risk Threats" section
6. Verify table shows blocked IPs
```

### Test 2: Manual Scan
```
1. On Admin Dashboard, find "🔄 Scan & Block Now" button
2. Click it
3. See alert with new blocking summary
4. Table updates with latest blocked IPs
```

### Test 3: Verify in Database
```
1. Open backend database (instance/users.db)
2. Check blocked_threat table:
   - Look for entries where blocked_by = 'admin'
   - reason contains "Auto-blocked"
3. Check threat_action_log table:
   - Look for action = 'auto_block'
   - verify details contain threat info
```

## Console Output

When auto-blocking runs, you'll see in backend console:

```
🛡️ [AUTO-BLOCK] Starting automatic threat blocking system...
✅ [AUTO-BLOCK] Loaded 30 threats from cache
📊 [AUTO-BLOCK] Found 12 high-risk threats (score >= 75)
✅ [AUTO-BLOCK] Blocked IP 192.168.1.100 (success=true)
⚠️  [AUTO-BLOCK] IP 10.0.0.5 already blocked by admin
❌ [AUTO-BLOCK] Invalid IP format: not_an_ip
🎯 [AUTO-BLOCK] SUMMARY
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
  Total threats: 30
  High-risk: 12
  ✅ Successfully auto-blocked: 8
  ⚠️  Already blocked: 3
  ❌ Invalid IPs: 1
  ⊘ Skipped: 0
```

---

## Key Features Explained

### 1. Automatic Detection
- Reads threat cache from `recent_threats.json`
- Looks for threats with risk score ≥ 75 (HIGH)
- Only processes valid IP addresses

### 2. Smart Blocking
- Creates database record (BlockedThreat)
- Logs action for audit trail (ThreatActionLog)
- Calls IP blocker to actually block the IP
- Prevents blocking same IP twice

### 3. Dashboard Display
- Shows auto-blocked IPs in a table
- Color codes risk scores:
  - 🔴 Red: Score ≥ 75 (HIGH)
  - 🟠 Orange: Score 50-74 (MEDIUM)
  - 🟡 Yellow: Score < 50 (LOW)
- Shows status: 🟢 Active or ⚫ Inactive
- Click "Scan & Block Now" for manual trigger

### 4. Security
- Only admins can access (JWT verified)
- IPs validated before blocking
- Duplicates prevented
- All actions logged with timestamp and user ID

---

## What Gets Blocked?

### Will Block
✅ Threats with risk score ≥ 75 (HIGH)  
✅ Valid IPv4 addresses (1.2.3.4 format)  
✅ Valid IPv6 addresses (::1 format)  
✅ Any threat type (Malware, Phishing, DDoS, etc.)  

### Won't Block
❌ Threats with score < 75  
❌ Invalid IP formats  
❌ Already-blocked IPs (shows in "already_blocked" list)  
❌ IPs without valid threat indicator

## Example Flow

```
Timeline:
10:00:00 - Admin logs in and goes to Admin Dashboard
10:00:05 - Frontend loads threats and admin data
10:00:06 - Auto-block timer triggers (1 second delay)
10:00:07 - API call: POST /api/admin/auto-block-threats
10:00:08 - Backend loads 30 threats from cache
10:00:09 - Filters: finds 12 high-risk threats
10:00:10 - Validates IPs: 10 valid, 2 invalid
10:00:11 - Checks existing: 8 new, 2 already blocked
10:00:12 - Creates database records for 8 new blocks
10:00:13 - Blocks IPs in global blocker
10:00:14 - Returns summary to frontend
10:00:15 - Alert shows: "🛡️ Auto-Blocked 8 high-risk threats!"
10:00:16 - Table displays blocked IPs with details
```

---

## Customization

### Change Risk Threshold (currently 75)
In `backend/app.py` around line 1643:
```python
# Current:
high_risk = [t for t in threats if t.get("score", 0) >= 75]

# Change to 70:
high_risk = [t for t in threats if t.get("score", 0) >= 70]
```

### Change Auto-Block Delay (currently 1 second)
In `frontend/src/components/AdminDashboard.js` around line 330:
```javascript
// Current: 1000ms (1 second)
setTimeout(() => { autoBlockThreats(); }, 1000);

// Change to 2 seconds:
setTimeout(() => { autoBlockThreats(); }, 2000);
```

### Disable Auto-Block on Dashboard Load
In `frontend/src/components/AdminDashboard.js` around line 330:
```javascript
// Comment out or delete:
/*
useEffect(() => {
  const timer = setTimeout(() => {
    autoBlockThreats();
  }, 1000);
  return () => clearTimeout(timer);
}, []);
*/
```

## Troubleshooting

### Issue: No auto-block alert appears
**Solution:**
1. Check browser console (F12) for errors
2. Verify admin JWT token is valid
3. Check backend console for [AUTO-BLOCK] messages
4. Ensure `recent_threats.json` exists and has threats

### Issue: Table is empty
**Solution:**
1. No high-risk threats in current feed (score < 75)
2. All threats already blocked
3. Invalid IPs in threat data
4. Click "Scan & Block Now" to manually trigger

### Issue: IPs not actually blocked
**Solution:**
1. Check database (blocked_threat table) for records
2. Verify ip_blocker.py is working
3. Check if IP is in whitelist
4. Review backend console for error messages

### Issue: Database errors
**Solution:**
1. Check if BlockedThreat and ThreatActionLog tables exist
2. Run migrations: `flask db upgrade`
3. Check database permissions
4. Review backend error logs

## Monitored Metrics

The system tracks:
- ✅ Total threats in feed
- ✅ High-risk threats (score ≥ 75)
- ✅ Successfully auto-blocked count
- ✅ Already-blocked count
- ✅ Invalid IP addresses
- ✅ Skipped threats
- ✅ Timestamp of each block
- ✅ Admin user ID
- ✅ Threat details (type, score, category)

---

## Database Records

### BlockedThreat Table
Each auto-block creates a record with:
- `ip_address`: The blocked IP
- `threat_type`: Type of threat
- `risk_score`: Score that triggered block
- `risk_category`: High/Medium/Low
- `summary`: Threat description
- `blocked_by`: "admin" (auto-blocks)
- `blocked_by_user_id`: Admin user ID
- `reason`: "Auto-blocked: High-risk threat (score X)"
- `blocked_at`: Timestamp
- `is_active`: true (unless unblocked)

### ThreatActionLog Table
Each auto-block creates a log with:
- `action`: "auto_block"
- `ip_address`: The blocked IP
- `threat_id`: Reference to BlockedThreat
- `performed_by_user_id`: Admin user ID
- `details`: JSON with threat info
- `timestamp`: When blocked
